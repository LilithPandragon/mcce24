# master thesis and thesis book template
This project is a template for the MCCE master thesis and its thesis book. You can produce the PDFs by using Visual Studio Code in combination with the [TEXLive](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-docker/pkgs/container/texlive-full) Docker container. 

# Preparing Visual Studio Code

Follow the instructions available on the following web page.

[How to setup VS Code to compile LaTeX using Docker containers?](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nuric/posts/coding/how-to-setup-vs-code-to-compile-latex-using-docker-containers/)

# LTeX – LanguageTool grammar/spell checking

[LTeX](LTeX – LanguageTool grammar/spell checking) is an extension for Visual Studio Code. It finds grammar ans spelling issues and proposes fixes.

# grammar/spell check using Microsoft Word

LTeX finds a lot of mistakes but not all. Combining it with the grammar/spell checker of Microsoft Word finds most of your mistakes. Open the generated PDF in word and trigger a check to get a list of issues.
